    content: "My\_approach to\_teaching is informed by my\_commitment\_to\_education\_as\_a collaborative enterprise\_best pursued through pedagogies that\_involve\_every student in the learning process.\_As an educator, I am invested in developing dynamic classrooms\_utilizing\_creative\_strategies and activities\_that inspire student engagement\_with me, assigned materials, and each other.\_As a result,\_I view each class as an opportunity to generate a learning community where students, working together, are inspired to take ownership of\_assigned materials and class topics\_through thoughtful\_discussion and\_analysis.\_\_\n\nOne\_of the ways I encourage students to take ownership of class topics is by empowering them with both theory and methodology\_at the beginning of each semester.\_For example, when I teach my course “Women and Religion in America Today,” students spend\_the first few class sessions\_reading and analyzing\_key concepts in theories\_of lived religion and ethnographic methodology.\_They then mobilize what they\_have learned\_as they explore course content throughout the rest of the semester by\_addressing various\_ways assigned primary and secondary source materials\_utilize\_these theoretical and methodological approaches.\_When writing their summary-analysis papers,\_which\_are designed to\_prepare them for our\_seminar-style\_class sessions,\_students\_address what they see as the strengths and limitations of the assigned author’s theoretical and methodological approaches\_supporting\_their claims with\_textual references.\_This encourages students to\_actively and\_critically\_engage with assigned materials\_beyond simply learning\_content.\_\_\_\n\n\_I am committed\_to facilitating seminar-style class sessions that are flexibly structured so that students can focus\_on topics from the assigned readings that\_they\_find relevant, challenging, or confusing.\_After working with students\_to form a solid foundation\_as a large group, I usually\_then\_facilitate\_paired\_or\_small\_group work to explore what they are learning in new and synergetic ways.\_Memorably,\_during\_one “Modern Religion and Culture” class session, we\_used sidewalk chalk outside\_on a beautifully sunny day\_to\_sketch\_timelines in preparation for\_an\_upcoming exam.\_By the end of our session, students were collaborating to construct\_visual representations of\_class materials in\_colorful,\_creative\_ways—including timelines in the shapes of maps, umbrellas\_and balloons—that\_we\_then\_ended up photographing\_for\_reference later as they prepared for their\_final\_exam.\_\_\_\n\nI like to have\_semesters\_culminate\_in a series of peer-led\_mini lessons\_that students are responsible for crafting and executing with their classmates.\_ Each\_lesson incorporates primary and secondary source materials, a lecture or activity, and\_a facilitated group discussion.\_In\_one iteration of my “Women and Religion in America Today” course, there was\_a\_lesson on yoga and cultural appropriation in the United States that was\_particularly compelling\_in that it asked\_fellow\_students to think about their own compliance with culturally\_appropriative practices\_embedded in an\_activity\_in which\_nearly everyone had participated.\_I find that concluding the semester\_with these mini lessons reinforces for students\_not only\_the importance of being mindful of theory and methodology\_but also, more importantly,\_their own\_potential\_in\_being contributing members of their academic communities.\_\n\nIn recognition of my success in teaching\_at The University of Iowa, I received the Rev. Louis P. Penningroth Award for excellence in teaching and mentoring\_from the\_Department of\_Religious\_Studies\_in 2018.\_My effectiveness in the classroom is\_also\_attested to by my course evaluations.\_Statistically,\_I have been rated among the highest performing instructors both in my department and in the College of Liberal Arts Sciences more broadly.\_One student\_from\_my “Digital Media and Religion” course commented:\_“This has been my favorite class so far!\_Each class we are presented with new ideas and ways in which to view the world.\_I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to both the instructor and my classmates’ ideas on the topics covered in class.”\_\_\_\n\nIn all of my roles as an educator—as a teacher, a mentor, an advocate,\_and\_a facilitator—I aim to\_empower students with the knowledge that they are capable of not only contributing to but actually shaping\_the contours of their academic experiences.\_By the end of our time together,\_I hope that\_students leave my classes believing they are valuable\_and contributing\_members\_of their learning communities, both on campus and more broadly.\_\_\_\n"

    content: >
      My approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion has been profoundly shaped
      by my experiences tutoring ELL learners over the last dozen years. The
      challenges that immigrants and refugees face very rarely stem from a
      single aspect of their identities; rather, they, like all of us, interact
      with the world through intersecting identities related to categories like
      race, gender, sexuality, income, immigration status, and religion. As a
      result, I am committed, as an educator and researcher, to engaging with my
      students, colleagues, and fellow community members by acknowledging and
      celebrating our intersecting identity categories.


      As a volunteer with a variety of service organizations that specialize in
      ELL programing for immigrant and refugee populations (including the Somali
      Services Coalition, Giving+Learning, and the YWCA), I have learned that
      the most effective teaching occurs when we, as educators, attend to the
      individual needs of our students. For example, standard ELL programming
      may not always address the needs of adult learners. Because ELL students
      are often navigating complex legal systems as they work through the
      immigration process, for instance, they may be better served with classes
      that unpack some of the complex legalese they are expected to negotiate
      for themselves and their families. As the spouse of a now naturalized
      citizen—my partner is a Palestinian who grew up in Lebanon—I have learned
      firsthand the stress and uncertainty that accompanies the naturalization
      process, particularly in a political climate that is often hostile towards
      immigrants broadly and Arabs more specifically.


      As an educator at The University of Iowa, many, but not all, of my
      students are racially privileged and a considerable number of them are
      from rural Iowa, often with little experience interacting with diverse
      communities. I myself am from a very small town in Minnesota and grew up
      in a very racially and ethnically homogenous environment. As a result, I
      have worked to centralize diverse materials, methodologies, and
      theoretical approaches in my classes to equip my students with the tools
      necessary to engage and thrive in more diverse environments. For example,
      while it would, perhaps, be easier to teach a more standard version of a
      world religions course centralizing texts, institutional histories, and
      male experiences, my world religions syllabus centralizes questions of
      gender and what we learn about various religious traditions when we look
      to the margins rather than to the center.


      As a scholar, I embrace diversity both in terms of my methodological and
      theoretical orientations as well as in my choice of subject matter. In
      addition to my work on North American religions, including mainstream
      denominations, new religious movements, and indigenous spiritualities, I
      have extensive graduate training in gender, women’s, and sexuality studies
      as well as considerable fluency with Islam and the history and politics of
      the Middle East. I approach these diverse topics by applying innovative
      theoretical perspectives like new materialisms and affect theory, which
      lend themselves to novel interpretations of the relationship between
      humans and their various environments.


      Finally, I am committed to seeking out service and public engagement
      opportunities that specifically address intersectional concerns both on
      campus and in my community, from more explicitly activist engagements in
      the forms of marches, sit-ins, and rallies to more educational
      opportunities like leading and participating in workshops and discussions.
      As a graduate student at The University of Iowa, I served on the UI
      Council on the Status of Women and participated in the Iowa N.E.W.
      Leadership Institute. Additionally, I regularly offered workshops through
      a variety of local community organizations that worked to raise awareness
      and dispel misunderstandings concerning women and gender in Islam.


      After graduation, I intend to continue to implement my intersectional
      feminist values through my research, teaching, and service both on and off
      campus.
