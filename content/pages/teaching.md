    content: "My\_approach to\_teaching is informed by my\_commitment\_to\_education\_as\_a collaborative enterprise\_best pursued through pedagogies that\_involve\_every student in the learning process.\_As an educator, I am invested in developing dynamic classrooms\_utilizing\_creative\_strategies and activities\_that inspire student engagement\_with me, assigned materials, and each other.\_As a result,\_I view each class as an opportunity to generate a learning community where students, working together, are inspired to take ownership of\_assigned materials and class topics\_through thoughtful\_discussion and\_analysis.\_\_\n\nOne\_of the ways I encourage students to take ownership of class topics is by empowering them with both theory and methodology\_at the beginning of each semester.\_For example, when I teach my course “Women and Religion in America Today,” students spend\_the first few class sessions\_reading and analyzing\_key concepts in theories\_of lived religion and ethnographic methodology.\_They then mobilize what they\_have learned\_as they explore course content throughout the rest of the semester by\_addressing various\_ways assigned primary and secondary source materials\_utilize\_these theoretical and methodological approaches.\_When writing their summary-analysis papers,\_which\_are designed to\_prepare them for our\_seminar-style\_class sessions,\_students\_address what they see as the strengths and limitations of the assigned author’s theoretical and methodological approaches\_supporting\_their claims with\_textual references.\_This encourages students to\_actively and\_critically\_engage with assigned materials\_beyond simply learning\_content.\_\_\_\n\n\_I am committed\_to facilitating seminar-style class sessions that are flexibly structured so that students can focus\_on topics from the assigned readings that\_they\_find relevant, challenging, or confusing.\_After working with students\_to form a solid foundation\_as a large group, I usually\_then\_facilitate\_paired\_or\_small\_group work to explore what they are learning in new and synergetic ways.\_Memorably,\_during\_one “Modern Religion and Culture” class session, we\_used sidewalk chalk outside\_on a beautifully sunny day\_to\_sketch\_timelines in preparation for\_an\_upcoming exam.\_By the end of our session, students were collaborating to construct\_visual representations of\_class materials in\_colorful,\_creative\_ways—including timelines in the shapes of maps, umbrellas\_and balloons—that\_we\_then\_ended up photographing\_for\_reference later as they prepared for their\_final\_exam.\_\_\_\n\nI like to have\_semesters\_culminate\_in a series of peer-led\_mini lessons\_that students are responsible for crafting and executing with their classmates.\_ Each\_lesson incorporates primary and secondary source materials, a lecture or activity, and\_a facilitated group discussion.\_In\_one iteration of my “Women and Religion in America Today” course, there was\_a\_lesson on yoga and cultural appropriation in the United States that was\_particularly compelling\_in that it asked\_fellow\_students to think about their own compliance with culturally\_appropriative practices\_embedded in an\_activity\_in which\_nearly everyone had participated.\_I find that concluding the semester\_with these mini lessons reinforces for students\_not only\_the importance of being mindful of theory and methodology\_but also, more importantly,\_their own\_potential\_in\_being contributing members of their academic communities.\_\n\nIn recognition of my success in teaching\_at The University of Iowa, I received the Rev. Louis P. Penningroth Award for excellence in teaching and mentoring\_from the\_Department of\_Religious\_Studies\_in 2018.\_My effectiveness in the classroom is\_also\_attested to by my course evaluations.\_Statistically,\_I have been rated among the highest performing instructors both in my department and in the College of Liberal Arts Sciences more broadly.\_One student\_from\_my “Digital Media and Religion” course commented:\_“This has been my favorite class so far!\_Each class we are presented with new ideas and ways in which to view the world.\_I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to both the instructor and my classmates’ ideas on the topics covered in class.”\_\_\_\n\nIn all of my roles as an educator—as a teacher, a mentor, an advocate,\_and\_a facilitator—I aim to\_empower students with the knowledge that they are capable of not only contributing to but actually shaping\_the contours of their academic experiences.\_By the end of our time together,\_I hope that\_students leave my classes believing they are valuable\_and contributing\_members\_of their learning communities, both on campus and more broadly.\_\_\_\n"

    content: "My\_approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion has been profoundly shaped by my experiences tutoring ELL learners over the last dozen years\_or so.\_The challenges that immigrants and refugees face\_very rarely stem from a single aspect of their\_identities; rather, they, like all of us, interact with the world through intersecting identities related to categories like race, gender, sexuality, income, immigration status, and religion.\_As a result,\_I am committed, as an educator and researcher,\_to engaging with my students,\_colleagues, and fellow community members by acknowledging\_and celebrating our intersecting identity categories.\_\n\nAs a volunteer with a variety of service organizations that specialize in ELL programing for immigrant and refugee populations (including the Somali Services Coalition,\_Giving+Learning, and the YWCA), I have learned that\_the most effective\_teaching\_occurs when we, as educators, attend to the individual needs of our students.\_For example, standard ELL programming may not always address\_the\_particular experiences\_of adult learners.\_Because\_ELL students are often navigating complex legal systems as they work through the immigration process,\_for\_instance,\_they\_may be better served with classes that unpack some of the\_complex legalese they are expected to negotiate for themselves and their families.\_As the\_spouse\_of a now naturalized citizen—my\_partner\_is a Palestinian who grew up in Lebanon—I have\_learned firsthand\_the stress and uncertainty that accompanies\_the naturalization process, particularly in a political climate that is often hostile towards immigrants broadly and Arabs more specifically.\_\_\n\nAs an educator at The University of Iowa, many, but not all, of my students\_are racially privileged\_and a considerable number of them are from rural Iowa, often\_with\_little\_experience interacting with\_diverse communities.\_I myself am from a very small town in Minnesota and\_grew up in a\_decidedly\_racially and ethnically\_homogenous\_environment.\_As a result, I\_have worked to centralize diverse materials, methodologies, and theoretical approaches\_in my classes\_to equip my students with the tools necessary to engage and thrive in more diverse environments.\_For example,\_while it would, perhaps, be easier to teach a more\_standard version of\_a\_world religions\_course\_centralizing texts, institutional histories, and male experiences,\_my world religions syllabus centralizes questions of gender\_and\_what we learn about various religious traditions when we look to the margins rather than\_to\_the center.\_\_\n\nAs a\_scholar, I embrace diversity both in terms of my methodological and theoretical orientations as well as in my choice of subject matter.\_In addition to my work on North American religions,\_including mainstream denominations, new religious movements, and indigenous spiritualities,\_I have extensive\_graduate\_training in gender,\_women’s, and sexuality studies\_as well as\_considerable fluency with Islam and\_the\_history and politics\_of\_the Middle East.\_I approach these diverse topics by applying\_innovative theoretical perspectives like new materialisms and affect theory, which lend themselves to novel interpretations of the relationship between\_individuals\_and their\_various\_environments.\_\n\nFinally, I am committed to seeking out service and public engagement opportunities that specifically\_address\_intersectional concerns\_both on campus and in my community, from more explicitly activist engagements in the forms of marches, sit-ins, and rallies to more educational opportunities like leading and participating in workshops and discussions.\_As a graduate student at The University of Iowa, I served on the UI Council on the Status of Women and participated in the Iowa N.E.W. Leadership\_Institute.\_Additionally, I regularly offered workshops through a variety of local community organizations that worked to raise awareness and dispel misunderstandings concerning women and gender in Islam.\_In the future, I intend to continue to implement my intersectional feminist values through my research, teaching, and service\_both on and off campus.\_\n"
