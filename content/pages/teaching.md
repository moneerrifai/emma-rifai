      My approach to teaching is informed by my commitment to education as a
      collaborative enterprise best pursued through pedagogies that involve
      every student in the learning process. As an educator, I am invested in
      developing dynamic classrooms utilizing creative strategies and activities
      that inspire student engagement with me, assigned materials, and each
      other. As a result, I view each class as an opportunity to generate a
      learning community where students, working together, are inspired to take
      ownership of assigned materials and class topics through thoughtful
      discussion and analysis.


      One of the ways I encourage students to take ownership of class topics is
      by empowering them with both theory and methodology at the beginning of
      each semester. For example, when I teach my course “Women and Religion in
      America Today,” students spend the first few class sessions reading and
      analyzing key concepts in theories of lived religion and ethnographic
      methodology. They then mobilize what they have learned as they explore
      course content throughout the rest of the semester by addressing various
      ways assigned primary and secondary source materials utilize these
      theoretical and methodological approaches. When writing their
      summary-analysis papers, which are designed to prepare them for our
      seminar-style class sessions, students address what they see as the
      strengths and limitations of the assigned author’s theoretical and
      methodological approaches supporting their claims with textual references.
      This encourages students to actively and critically engage with assigned
      materials beyond simply learning content.


      I am committed to facilitating seminar-style class sessions that are
      flexibly structured so that students can focus on topics from the assigned
      readings that they find relevant, challenging, or confusing. After working
      with students to form a solid foundation as a large group, I usually then
      facilitate paired or small group work to explore what they are learning in
      new and synergetic ways. Memorably, during one “Modern Religion and
      Culture” class session, we used sidewalk chalk outside on a beautifully
      sunny day to sketch timelines in preparation for an upcoming exam. By the
      end of our session, students were collaborating to construct visual
      representations of class materials in colorful, creative ways—including
      timelines in the shapes of maps, umbrellas and balloons—that we then ended
      up photographing for reference later as they prepared for their final
      exam.


      I like to have semesters culminate in a series of peer-led mini lessons
      that students are responsible for crafting and executing with their
      classmates.  Each lesson incorporates primary and secondary source
      materials, a lecture or activity, and a facilitated group discussion. In
      one iteration of my “Women and Religion in America Today” course, there
      was a lesson on yoga and cultural appropriation in the United States that
      was particularly compelling in that it asked fellow students to think
      about their own compliance with culturally appropriative practices
      embedded in an activity in which nearly everyone had participated. I find
      that concluding the semester with these mini lessons reinforces for
      students not only the importance of being mindful of theory and
      methodology but also, more importantly, their own potential in being
      contributing members of their academic communities.


      In recognition of my success in teaching at The University of Iowa, I
      received the Rev. Louis P. Penningroth Award for excellence in teaching
      and mentoring from the Department of Religious Studies in 2018. My
      effectiveness in the classroom is also attested to by my course
      evaluations. Statistically, I have been rated among the highest performing
      instructors both in my department and in the College of Liberal Arts
      Sciences more broadly. One student from my “Digital Media and Religion”
      course commented: “This has been my favorite class so far! Each class we
      are presented with new ideas and ways in which to view the world. I have
      thoroughly enjoyed listening to both the instructor and my classmates’
      ideas on the topics covered in class.”


      In all of my roles as an educator—as a teacher, a mentor, an advocate, and
      a facilitator—I aim to empower students with the knowledge that they are
      capable of not only contributing to but actually shaping the contours of
      their academic experiences. By the end of our time together, I hope that
      students leave my classes believing they are valuable and contributing
      members of their learning communities, both on campus and off.

    section_id: diversitystatement

    content: >
      My approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion has been profoundly shaped
      by my experiences tutoring ELL learners over the last dozen years or so.
      The challenges that immigrants and refugees face very rarely stem from a
      single aspect of their identities; rather, they—like all of us—interact
      with the world through intersecting identities related to categories like
      race, gender, sexuality, income, immigration status, and religion. As a
      result, I am committed, as an educator and researcher, to engaging with my
      students, colleagues, and fellow community members by acknowledging and
      celebrating our intersecting identity categories.


      As a volunteer with a variety of service organizations that specialize in
      ELL programing for immigrant and refugee populations (including the Somali
      Services Coalition, Giving+Learning, and the YWCA), I have learned that
      the most effective teaching occurs when we, as educators, attend to the
      unique needs of our students. For example, standard ELL programming may
      not always address the particular experiences of adult learners. Because
      ELL students are often navigating complex legal systems as they work
      through the immigration process, for instance, they may be better served
      with classes that unpack some of the complex legalese they are expected to
      negotiate for themselves and their families. As the spouse of a now
      naturalized citizen—my partner is a Palestinian who grew up in Lebanon—I
      have learned firsthand the stress and uncertainty that accompanies the
      naturalization process, particularly in a political climate that is often
      hostile towards immigrants broadly and Arabs more specifically.


      As an educator at The University of Iowa, many, but not all, of my
      students were racially privileged and a considerable number of them from
      rural Iowa, often with little experience interacting with diverse
      communities. I myself am from a very small town in Minnesota and grew up
      in a decidedly racially and ethnically homogenous environment. In light of
      this, I have worked to centralize diverse materials, methodologies, and
      theoretical approaches in my classes to equip my students with the tools
      necessary to engage and thrive in more diverse environments. For example,
      while it would, perhaps, be easier to teach a more standard version of a
      world religions course centralizing texts, institutional histories, and
      male experiences, my world religions syllabus centralizes questions of
      gender and what we learn about various religious traditions when we look
      to the margins rather than to the center.


      As a scholar, I embrace diversity both in terms of my methodological and
      theoretical orientations as well as in my choice of subject matter. In
      addition to my work on North American religions, including mainstream
      denominations, new religious movements, and indigenous spiritualities, I
      have extensive graduate training in gender, women’s, and sexuality studies
      as well as considerable fluency with Islam and the history and politics of
      the Middle East. I approach these diverse topics by applying innovative
      theoretical perspectives like new materialisms and affect theory, which
      lend themselves to novel interpretations of the relationship between
      individuals and their various environments.


      Finally, I am committed to seeking out service and public engagement
      opportunities that specifically address intersectional concerns both on
      campus and in my community, from more explicitly activist engagements in
      the forms of marches, sit-ins, and rallies to more educational
      opportunities like leading and participating in workshops and discussions.
      During my time at The University of Iowa, I served on the UI Council on
      the Status of Women and participated in the Iowa N.E.W. Leadership
      Institute. Additionally, I regularly offered workshops through a variety
      of local community organizations that worked to raise awareness and dispel
      misunderstandings concerning women and gender in Islam. In the future, I
      intend to continue to implement my intersectional feminist values through
      my research, teaching, and service both on and off campus.
