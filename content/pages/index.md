    title: Greetings
    content: "Emma Rifai has a PhD from the Department of Religious Studies at The University of Iowa with graduate certificates in college teaching and gender, women’s and sexuality\_studies.\_ Her research explores how both religion and secularism shape the everyday at the site of the body by highlighting Protestant culture’s profound yet often overlooked impact on public life in the United States.\_ Her dissertation, entitled, “Secular Embodiments: Body Management, Protestant Culture, and American Secularism\_in the Twenty-First Century,” argues American secularism is a unique cultural formation that is best understood as fundamentally embodied and that its embodiments are made plain in contemporary\_body management cultures like direct-to-consumer genetic testing, biohacking, and the pro-ana movement. These case studies reveal\_how the relationship between individuals and culture is negotiated bilaterally at the site of the body through multiple mechanisms of power. Contributing to religious studies, cultural studies, and gender studies, this project demonstrates how American secularism is experienced in the gendered and raced body and how these experiences contribute to the construction of contemporary American culture.\_\n\nHer research and teaching interests include:\n\n*   Protestantism and Secularism in the United States\n\n*   Critical Theory and Religion\n\n*   Religion, Food, and the Body\n\n*   Gender, Religion, and Culture\n"
