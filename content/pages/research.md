    content: "American secularism is a pervasive and utterly inescapable aspect of life in the United States today.\_To participate in American public life is to engage with the\_particular secularism\_of the United States.\_And to engage with the\_particular secularism\_of the United States is to perpetuate a Protestant privilege embedded in the very fabric of this secularism on every scale, from institutions to individuals. While\_a number of\_scholars have attended to America’s particular form of secularism as it circulates in institutions like law, politics, and economics, less attention has been paid to how individuals embody American secularism in their daily lives.\_My research\_attends to this gap by\_exploring\_how both religion and\_secularism\_shape the everyday at the site of the body by\_highlighting\_Protestant culture’s profound yet often overlooked impact on public life in the United States.\_\n\nMy dissertation, entitled “Secular Embodiments: Body Management, Protestant Culture, and American Secularism in the Twenty-First Century,” argues that American secularism is a unique cultural formation that is best understood as fundamentally embodied and that its embodiments are made plain in contemporary techniques of body management.\_I\_find\_that the body is a foundational site where it is possible to see the co-constitutive nature of the secular and the religious emerge as well as the scope and contours of their entangled ontologies. This entanglement is particularly clear when considering how American secularism is imbued with the same Protestant values, including commitments to individualism, self-control, and optimization, that orient American cultural life more broadly.\_Through case studies on direct-to-consumer genetic testing, biohacking, and the pro-ana movement, this project explores the tensions between the discourses and practices that seek to sustain American secularism through multiple mechanisms of power and the bodies that confound these attempts by expanding and contracting the field of possibility from which the contemporary subject emerges.\_\n\n“Secular Embodiments” is structured around three case studies, each of which considers a different body management culture made popular in the early twenty-first century. My first case study explores the logics of direct-to-consumer genetic testing and the role this practice plays in contemporary subject production.\_Through an analysis of the published marketing\_and media of at-home genetic testing companies like 23andMe, I reveal how American individualism is refracted through genetic science and digital technologies at the site of the body as a new expression of biopower, a mechanism of power that operates on the scale of population.\_My second case study analyzes the disciplinary\_rhetorics\_and practices of the hyper-masculinized biohacking movement and how this movement mobilizes and capitalizes on the\_particular logics\_of optimization.\_In this chapter, I consider how entrepreneurs like Tim Ferriss, Dave Asprey, and Ben Greenfield peddle biohacking techniques in ways that privilege particularly white, male, wealthy, and reasonably healthy bodies.\_My third case study demonstrates how self-control is managed in the online pro-ana movement through daily practices that sustain and diminish life and liveliness in abject, gendered bodies.\_In this chapter, I analyze the popular pro-ana site\_MyPancakeAddiction\_and track embodiments of pro-ana digital culture and performances of shared value systems that reflect a\_particularly\_Protestant, and feminized, orientation toward the self and the body.\_\_\n\nContributing to religious studies, cultural studies, and gender studies, my project makes plain the ways in which American secularism is embodied and thus corrects a longstanding disregard for the bodily techniques that sustain public life in the United States. Its case studies reveal that both secular and religious practices privilege Protestant ways of engaging with the world, often through intimately embodied experiences of gender, race, and class.\_Protestantism is stubborn and persistent, in part, because it lurks in the body, in daily behaviors and practices that, on the surface, seem neutral, natural,\_and even accidental.\_“Secular Embodiments,” then, illustrates the profound influence of Protestantism on the articulation of secular subjecthood in twenty-first century bodily techniques shaped by modern genetic science and digital technologies. Indeed, attending to performances of contemporary body management cultures reveals the privileging of particular bodies\_through a persistent Protestantism finding purchase in new expressions of American secularism.\_\_\n\nMy larger research agenda\_attends to the\_religio-secular assemblages that shape and are shaped by everyday embodiments in the contemporary United States.\_I have refereed articles\_published\_with both the\_*Journal of Religion, Media, and Digital Culture*\_and\_*Religion Compass*.\_The former is entitled\_“Digital\_Waistlands: Pro-Ana Communities, Religion, and Embodiment”\_and\_attends to the intersection of religion, embodiment, and digital culture in the pro-ana movement by exploring how\_anas\_embody\_religio-secular values in their performances of ana culture.\_The latter is entitled\_“Weighty Matter(s): Religion, Secularism, and American Weight Loss Culture”\_and summarizes the state of this fairly new field of research in religious studies. Finally, I am developing a book proposal based on my dissertation that I will be prepared to discuss with editors in the very near future.\_\_\n\nMy next research project\_considers the\_early\_nineteenth century\_American diet reform movements\_that flourished\_alongside\_the\_rapid urbanization, industrialization, and\_emergence of an identifiable print public in the United States.\_These movements\_not only linked body size with morality and connected body regulation to the rise of American consumer culture but also worked to establish hierarchies of race, sexuality, gender, and class.\_While much of the work on early American weight loss movements has centered on Sylvester Graham and his followers, I am exploring another trend:\_the water cure, a movement that was largely dominated by women in the United States.\_Most hydropathic spas were run by women and functioned as epicenters for dress reform, temperance, and the women’s rights movement. Indeed,\_the first\_National Dress Reform Association meeting was held at the Glenhaven Water-Cure.\_Through an analysis of this trend’s primary periodical\_*Water-Cure Journal*,\_published between 1845 and 1857, I\_will\_trace changing attitudes\_toward the body in light of the personal ads it ran that included height and weight specifications for prospective partners.\_Because other preferences like political orientation and religious affiliation were also listed, I expect to find evidence of shifting attitudes\_towards\_both religion and secularism as well.\_A careful reading and analysis of the\_*Water-Cure Journal*\_will offer\_important\_contributions\_in our understanding of evolving orientations not only toward the body but also toward\_religion,\_secularism, and the persistence of Protestant culture embedded in the increasingly secular imperative to count calories from the mid- to late nineteenth century in the United States.\_\n\nBroadly, my work is\_an\_interdisciplinary engagement with themes\_of\_Protestant\_culture and American secularism; critical theory and religion; religion, food, and the body; and gender, religion, and culture.\_I am committed to exploring the intersections of religion and secularism in the contemporary United States as they manifest as embodied practices\_in the everyday.\_This work offers important contributions to the fields of religious studies, cultural studies, and gender studies by shifting the primary unit of analysis from populations to the individual and\_by considering\_how the individual, gendered body mediates the secular and the religious through daily actions and behaviors.\_\n"

      ###### Embodying the Secular: Power, Bodies, and American Secularism


      American secularism is a pervasive and utterly inescapable aspect of life
      in the United States today. To participate in American public life is to
      engage with the particular secularism of the United States. And to engage
      with the particular secularism of the United States is to perpetuate a
      Protestant privilege embedded in the very fabric of this secularism on
      every scale, from institutions to individuals. While a number of scholars
      have attended to America’s particular form of secularism as it circulates
      in institutions like law, politics, and economics, less attention has been
      paid to how individuals embody American secularism in their daily lives.


      “Embodying the Secular: Power, Bodies, and American Secularism” argues
      that American secularism is best understood as fundamentally embodied and
      that this embodiment is made plain in contemporary techniques of body
      management. It finds that the body is a foundational site where it is
      possible to see the co-constitutive nature of the “secular” and the
      “religious” emerge as well as the scope and contours of their entangled
      ontologies. This entanglement is particularly clear when considering how
      American secularism is imbued with the same Protestant values, including
      commitments to individualism, self-control, and optimization, that orient
      American cultural life more broadly. Through case studies on
      direct-to-consumer genetic testing, biohacking, and the pro-ana movement,
      this dissertation explores the tensions between the discourses and
      practices that seek to sustain American secularism and the bodies that
      confound these attempts by expanding and contracting the field of
      possibility from which the contemporary American subject emerges.


      Intervening in religious studies, cultural studies, and gender studies,
      this project makes plain the ways in which American secularism is embodied
      and thus corrects a longstanding disregard for the bodily techniques that
      sustain public life in the United States. It is not arbitrary or
      insignificant that Protestant values and American secularism are
      co-constituted at the site of the gendered body through popular body
      management practices. Indeed, the continued daily performances of American
      secularism and hegemonic Protestantism by gendered bodies through popular
      body management practices reveals just how central embodiment is to the
      construction of American culture today.
